When using Drill, you need to configure memory to make sufficient memory available for your application. The more memory for Drill, the better. You may need to modify options for performance or functionality. For example, the default storage format for CTAS
statements is Parquet. You can modify the default setting so that output data
is stored in CSV or JSON format. The many options you can configure are covered in this section. This section also includes stopping and restarting a Drillbit on a node, ports used by Drill, and partition pruning.
