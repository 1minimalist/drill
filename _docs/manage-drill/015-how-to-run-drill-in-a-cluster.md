Drill operations are memory and CPU-intensive. You need to statically partition the cluster to designation which partition handles which workload. For example, you have 120G of available memory that you allocate to following workloads in a Yarn-enabled cluster:

File system = 20G  
HBase = 20G  
Yarn = 20G  
OS = 8G  

To add Drill to the cluster, how do you change memory allocation? It depends on your application. If Yarn does most of the work, give Drill 20G, for example, and give Yarn 60G. If you expect a heavy query load, give Drill 60G and Drill 20G.

{% include startnote.html %}Drill will execute queries within Yarn soon.{% include endnote.html %}

For information about Drill and Yarn, see [DRILL-142](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DRILL-142).

## Managing Memory

To run Drill in a cluster with MapReduce, HBase, Spark, and other workloads, allocate memory in the same manner according to your application needs. 

To run Drill in a MapR cluster, allocate memory by configuring settings in warden.conf, as described in the [MapR documentation]().

## Allocating Memory for Drill
You can configure the amount of direct memory allocated to a Drillbit for
query processing. The default limit is 8G, but Drill prefers 16G or more
depending on the workload. The total amount of direct memory that a Drillbit
allocates to query operations cannot exceed the limit set.

Drill mainly uses Java direct memory and performs well when executing
operations in memory instead of storing the operations on disk. Drill does not
write to disk unless absolutely necessary, unlike MapReduce where everything
is written to disk during each phase of a job.

The JVMâ€™s heap memory does not limit the amount of direct memory available in
a Drillbit. The on-heap memory for Drill is only about 4-8G, which should
suffice because Drill avoids having data sit in heap memory.

You can modify memory for each Drillbit node in your cluster. To modify the
memory for a Drillbit, edit the `XX:MaxDirectMemorySize` parameter in the
Drillbit startup script located in `<drill_installation_directory>/conf/drill-
env.sh`.

If this parameter is not set, the limit depends on the amount of available system memory.

### Managing Memory in a MapR Cluster
Memory and disk for Drill and other services that are not associated with roles on a MapR cluster are shared with other services. You manage the chunk of memory for these services in os heap settings in `warden.conf` and in configuration files of the particular service. The warden os heap settings are:

    service.command.os.heapsize.percent
    service.command.os.heapsize.max
    service.command.os.heapsize.min

For more information about managing memory in a MapR cluster, see [Memory Allocation for Nodes](http://doc.mapr.com/display/MapR40x/Memory+Allocation+for+Nodes) in the MapR documentation.

## How to Manage Drill CPU Resources
Currently, you do not manage CPU resources within Drill. [Use Linux `cgroups`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) to manage the CPU resources.
