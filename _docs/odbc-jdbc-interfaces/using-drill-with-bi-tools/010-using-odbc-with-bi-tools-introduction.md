The MapR Drill ODBC driver provides BI tools access to Drillâ€™s flexible query
capabilities so that users can quickly explore various data sources. The MapR
Drill ODBC driver includes Drill Explorer, which is a simple user interface
that enables users to examine the content of data sources and create views
before visualizing the data in a BI tool.

Once you install the MapR Drill ODBC Driver on Windows, you can create ODBC DSNs to Drill
data sources using the ODBC Administrator tool and then use the DSNs to access
the data from BI tools that work with ODBC. Drill can connect to data with
well-defined schemas, such as Hive. Drill can also connect directly to data
that is self-describing, such as HBase, Parquet, JSON, CSV, and TSV.

The following figure shows how a BI tool on Windows uses an ODBC connection to
access data from a Hive table:

The following components provide applications access to Drill data sources:
