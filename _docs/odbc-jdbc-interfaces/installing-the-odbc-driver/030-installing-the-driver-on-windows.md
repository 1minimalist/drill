The MapR Drill ODBC Driver installer is available for 32- and 64-bit
applications on WindowsÂ®. On 64-bit Windows operating systems, you can execute both 32- and 64-bit applications. However, 64-bit applications must use 64-bit drivers, and 32-bit applications must use 32-bit drivers. Make sure that you use the driver version that matches the bitness of the client application machine. 
					
  * MapR Drill 1.3 32-bit.msi for 32-bit applications
  * MapR Drill 1.3 64-bit.msi for 64-bit applications


Install the MapR Drill ODBC Driver on a system that meets the system requirements. 

##  System Requirements

Each computer where you install the driver must meet the following system
requirements:

  * One of the following operating systems are supported:
    * Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10
    * Windows Server 2008 or later
  * 75 MB of available disk space
  * .NET Framework 4.5, installed and enabled by default on Windows 8 and later
  * Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013 installed (with the same bitness as the driver that you are installing)
 
  * The client must be able to resolve the actual host name of the Drill node or nodes from the IP address. Verify that a DNS entry was created on the client machine for the Drill node or nodes.   
If not, create an entry in `\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` for each node in the following format:  

    `<drill-machine-IP> <drill-machine-hostname>`  
    Example: `127.0.0.1 localhost`

 {% include startnote.html %}Currently Drill does not support a 32-bit Windows machine; however, the 32- or 64-bit MapR Drill ODBC Driver is supported on a 64-bit machine.{% include endnote.html %}

To install the driver, you need Administrator privileges on the computer.

----------

## Step 1: Download the MapR Drill ODBC Driver

Download the installer that corresponds to the bitness of the client application from which you want to create an ODBC connection. Version 1.3.8 is the current version.
