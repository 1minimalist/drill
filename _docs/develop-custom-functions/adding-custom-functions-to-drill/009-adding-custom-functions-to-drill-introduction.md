As of Drill 1.9, there are two methods for adding custom functions to Drill. An administrator can manually add functions to Drill, or provide users access to a staging directory where they can upload JAR files and register their UDFs using the CREATE FUNCTION USING JAR command. The CREATE FUNCTION USING JAR command is part of the Dynamic UDF feature.
