Installing Drill in embedded mode installs Drill locally on your machine.
Embedded mode is a quick way to install and try Drill without having to
perform any configuration tasks. Installing Drill in embedded mode configures the
local Drillbit service to start automatically when you launch the Drill shell. You can install Drill in embedded mode on a machine
running Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

**Prerequisite:**

You need to meet the following prerequisites to run Drill:

* Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows: [Oracle Java SE Development (JDK) Kit 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) installation  
* Windows only:  
  * A JAVA_HOME environment variable set up that points to the JDK installation  
  * A PATH environment variable that includes a pointer to the JDK installation  
  * A third-party utility for unzipping a tar.gz file 

Follow installation instructions in this documentation for your particular operating system.
