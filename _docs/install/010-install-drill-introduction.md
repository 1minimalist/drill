You can install Drill in either embedded mode or distributed mode. Installing
Drill in embedded mode does not require any configuration. To use Drill in a
clustered Hadoop environment, install Drill in distributed mode. You need to perform some configuration after installing Drill in distributed mode. After you complete these tasks, connect Drill to your Hive, HBase, or distributed file system
data sources, and run queries on them.
