Today I'm happy to announce the availability of the Drill 1.1 release. This release addresses [162 JIRAs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313820&version=12329689) on top of May's 1.0 release. Highlights include:

#### Automatic Partitioning for Parquet files
Drill now supports creating partitions automatically when using CREATE TABLE AS (CTAS) to generate Parquet files. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the Parquet file format, Drill is able provide this capability and still maintain data integrity and compatibility with all other systems that consume Parquet (a world first). This functionality can be exercised by utilizing the new [PARTITION BY](https://drill.apache.org/docs/partition-by-clause/) clause support.

#### Support for Window Functions
Drill now has first-class support for SQL Window Functions. This includes support for:

  * Aggregate Functions: AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM
  * Ranking Functions: CUME_DIST, DENSE_RANK, PERCENT_RANK, RANK and ROW_NUMBER
  
The community has done an excellent job providing a [comprehensive set of documentation](https://drill.apache.org/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/) so that you can starting using window functions immediately.  

#### Hive Storage Plugin Enhancements
We've enhanced Drill to work even better with Hive.  We started by upgrading Drill's support to work with Hive 1.0.  In addition, Drill now provides a very powerful new security feature called [delegated Hive impersonation](https://drill.apache.org/docs/configuring-user-impersonation-with-hive-authorization/).  Compatibility and performance are also improved with better data type support (including support for binary, tinyint and smallint data types) and better concurrency.

#### SQL Union Improvements
We've enhanced support for SQL UNION functionality.  Drill now supports both UNION and UNION ALL capabilities.  We've also improved the query optimizer to better optimize plans that include the UNION clause.

#### New Features For Complex Data
Drill's complex data capabilities continue to be the best in the market, now including support for COUNT aggregations on various types of complex objects.  Drill also now has improved FLATTEN capabilities to support very large complex objects.

#### Improved JDBC Driver Compatibility
Apache Drill's JDBC driver continues to be improved.  This includes a number of enhancements and fixes to better support JDBC tools including [MicroStrategy](https://drill.apache.org/docs/using-microstrategy-analytics-with-apache-drill/), [Tibco Spotfire](https://drill.apache.org/docs/using-tibco-spotfire-desktop-with-drill/), [JReport](https://drill.apache.org/docs/configuring-jreport-with-drill/) and [SQuirreL](https://drill.apache.org/docs/using-jdbc-with-squirrel-on-windows/).  

The Apache Drill community now publishes the JDBC driver for easy inclusion in your personal application through the use of Maven coordinates.  You can incorporate Drill's JDBC driver into your application by [downloading it directly](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/drill/exec/drill-jdbc-all/1.1.0/drill-jdbc-all-1.1.0.jar) or referencing the following coordinates within your Maven application.  

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.drill.exec</groupId>
      <artifactId>drill-jdbc-all</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.0</version>
    </dependency>


#### MongoDB 3.0 Support
Drill's support for MongoDB has been improved.  Drill now uses MongoDB's latest Java Driver and has enhanced connection pooling for better performance and resilience in large-scale deployments.  Learn more on using the [MongoDB for Drill plugin](https://drill.apache.org/docs/mongodb-plugin-for-apache-drill/).

#### Many More Fixes
Drill include a number of other smaller fixes and enhancements for a [number of things](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12313820&version=12329689) including: 

  * improvements for certain types of exists and correlated subqueries
  * fixes for running Drill on Windows
  * improvements in implicit casting capabilities in schemaless scenarios
  * improvements in INFORMATION_SCHEMA
  * Fixes for both the WebUI and the Drill REST API


#### More Frequent Releases
The amazing Drill community continues to be the driving force behind these rapid iterative releases.  Thanks to all the [committers]({{ site.baseurl }}/team/) and contributors that made this release possible!  The community's goal continues to be maintaining a 4-6 release cycle throughout the summer.  This means you will have many more enhancements to look for in the next few months.
